## Outline

My note taking system consists of three seperate areas inspired from the zettelkasten system.

### Topics

Topics are overarching themes that I am interested in. They are broad and can contain many notes. All fleeting notes and Zettels are linked to these topics.

All my courses in school represents a topic. Different topics such as linear algebra are also represented

### Fleeting notes

Fleeting notes are notes that are taken in the moment. They are quick and dirty notes that are not meant to be kept. They are used to capture information in an unorganized way.

These notes should later be converted to Zettels or discarded. For example when I am in a lecture I will take fleeting notes to capture the information.

### Zettels

Zettels are the most important part of my note taking system. Each Zettel represent one atomic note.

With atomic I mean a note that introduce one concept and only one concept. If I want to capture multiple topics these should be in seperate Zettels and the Zettels should be linked together.

This is where Obsidian shines. It is very easy to link a note to another note.

## Workflow

To implement my system I use three important obsidian plugins:

- Templater
- Quickadd
- Dataview

I have setup templater Template for Topics, Zettels and Fleeting notes.
