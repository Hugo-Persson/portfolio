    <div class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">May 15, 2023</div>
    <p>
      Today marks the first public release of the Image to Markdown OCR tool.
      After several weeks of development and testing, I'm excited to share this
      project with the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      The initial version supports three OCR providers: Texify, SimpleTex, and
      pix2tex, each with its own strengths for different types of content.

    <h2 class="mb-2">Performance Improvements</h2>
    <div class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">June 3, 2023</div>
    <p>
      Made significant performance improvements to the image processing
      pipeline:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced latency by 40% for most conversions</li>
      <li>Added image preprocessing options for better OCR results</li>
      <li>
        Implemented caching to avoid redundant processing of identical images
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These changes should make the tool much more responsive, especially for
      users working with multiple formulas in quick succession.

    <h2 class="mb-2">New Integration Options</h2>
    <div class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">July 20, 2023</div>
    <p>Added new ways to integrate the tool with external services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>RESTful API for programmatic access</li>
      <li>CLI tool for command-line usage</li>
      <li>Webhook support for automated workflows</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These additions make it possible to incorporate Image to Markdown OCR into
      a variety of workflows, from simple desktop usage to complex automated
      document processing systems.
